	<div class="content">
		We present four new datasets for viticultural and vinicultural visual understanding: iVineyard, iCellar, iGrapevine, and VinePathology. We designed, gathered data for, cleaned, and provided numerical and natural language annotations for these datasets in collaboration with domain experts with the aim of (1) accelerating AI adoption in the realms of viticulture and oenology; (2) improving data efficiency and interpretability with data collection, task formulation, and annotation processes informed by domain expertise; (3) benchmarking the performance of representation learning algorithms on a suite of challenging downstream viti- and vini-cultural tasks that go beyond standard species classification. We provide analyses of qualitative and quantitative results of downstream tasks including fine-grained visual categorization, fine-grained image retrieval, image geo-localization, and object discovery, thus shedding light on the strengths and weaknesses of feature representations across a diverse set of tasks that are of scientific importance to viticulturists and oenologists. </div>

	<button class="collapsible"> Abstract: </button>
	<div class="content">Recent developments in image classification and naturallanguage processing, coupled with the rapid growth in so-cial  media  usage,  have  enabled  fundamental  advances  indetecting  breaking  events  around  the  world  in  real-time.Emergency response is one such area that stands to gainfrom  these  advances.   By  processing  billions  of  texts  andimages a minute,  events can be automatically detected toenable emergency response workers to better assess rapidlyevolving  situations  and  deploy  resources  accordingly.   Todate, most event detection techniques in this area have fo-cused on image-only or text-only approaches, limiting de-tection performance and impacting the quality of informa-tion delivered to crisis response teams.   In this paper,  wepresent a new multimodal fusion method that leverages bothimages  and  texts  as  input.   In  particular,  we  introduce  across-attention  module  that  can  filter  uninformative  andmisleading  components  from  weak  modalities  on  a  sam-ple by sample basis.  In addition, we employ a multimodalgraph-based approach to stochastically transition betweenembeddings  of  different  multimodal  pairs  during  trainingto  better  regularize  the  learning  process  as  well  as  deal-ing with limited training data by constructing new matchedpairs from different samples. We show that our method out-performs the unimodal approaches and strong multimodalbaselines by a large margin on three crisis-related tasks. </div>

	<!--Dissertation: <a href="/research/dissertation_hu.pdf">Information Design with Big Data</a>. 2019. Cornell University.
	<button class="collapsible"> Abstract: </button>
	<div class="content">
		This dissertation consists of three essays that investigate the effects of information
design from different aspects and in different business contexts.<br>
The first essay --- information design in storytelling --- studies the impact of
information structure in the form of induced suspense and surprise on audience
experience in the context of movie viewing, and identifies significant impacts of
surprise on audience experience and evaluation. By formulating the information
design problem as a constraint optimization problem as in Ely et al. (2015), we
propose and validate textual measures of suspense and surprise based on a merged
dataset of movie scripts, movie features, and market outcome statistics.<br>
The second essay --- cognitive categorization, memorability, and likability --- explores
what makes a visual design memorable and likable by proposing and providing
scalable methods to descriptively quantify and evaluate two cognitive processes for
logos: (1) perceptual categorization; and (2) functional categorization. With a dataset
consisting of 125,270 logo designs from the U.S. market, spanning 39 industry
categories, and annotated scores of memorability and likability, we evaluate both the
absolute and relative impacts of two forms of cognitive categorization and logo
features on design memorability and design likability. In addition, we explore multiple
methods for logo clustering and analyze drivers of memorability and likability. To
validate the cognitive interpretation of our proposed measures, we further gather and
incorporate human perceptual templates into the algorithm. We discuss managerial 
insights for logo design.<br>
Third essay reviews the existing research on the intersection with a focus on visual
image data and proposes a classification scheme for the diverse range of computer
vision methods and constructs for visual marketing that has been developed in the
literature. The classification criteria include the nature of research questions,
application contexts, computational methods, and forms of big data. Additionally, the
paper provides comparative evaluations of each criterion both horizontally and
vertically, a normative guide on the use of these systems and results under different
situations, and an agenda for future research.

		<li> Abstract: This paper develops new measures of suspense and surprise in multiple distinct contexts and document robust heterogenous effects of how experienced surprise drives consumer experience and market outcomes. We motivate our analysis using Ely, Frankel and Kamenicas (2015) model of demand for non-instrumental information goods, which prescribes how suspense and surprise (and possibly other aspects of belief dynamics) shape the experienced utility function of consumers. To test the idea of the model, we develop analogous yet distinct measures of (1) functional, (2) textual, and (3) visual in corresponding contexts: (1) NFL viewership, (2) movie consumption, and (3) logo designs. We find that experienced surprise (1) Granger causes more audience response and more positive sentiments towards NFL games, (2) leads to higher evaluation of movies, and (3) correlates with greater memorability of logos, whereas suspense appears to be less effective.</li>

	<div class="content"> Motivated by infamous cheating scandals in various industries and political events, we address the problem of detecting concealed information in technical settings. In this work, we explore acoustic-prosodic and linguistic indicators of information concealment by collecting a unique corpus of professionals practicing for oral exams while concealing information. We reveal subtle signs of concealed information in speech and text, compare, and contrast them with those in deception detection literature, thus uncovering the link between concealing information and deception. We then present a series of experiments that automatically detect concealed information from text and speech. We compare the use of acoustic-prosodic, linguistic, and individual feature sets, using different machine learning models. Finally, we present a multi-task learning framework with acoustic, linguistic, and individual features, that outperforms humman performance by over 15%.</div>

	<div class="content"> Mobile apps are one of the building blocks of the mobile digital economy. A
differentiating feature of mobile apps to traditional enterprise software is online
reviews, which are available on app marketplaces and represent a valuable source
of consumer feedback on the app. We create a supervised topic modeling approach
for app developers to use mobile reviews as useful sources of quality and customer
feedback, thereby complementing traditional software testing. The approach is
based on a constrained matrix factorization that leverages the relationship between
term frequency and a given response variable in addition to co-occurrences between
terms to recover topics that are both predictive of consumer sentiment and useful
for understanding the underlying textual themes. The factorization can provide
guidance on a single app’s performance as well as systematically compare different
apps over time for benchmarking of features and consumer sentiment. We apply
our approach using a dataset of over 81,000 mobile reviews over several years for
two of the most reviewed online travel agent apps from the iOS and Google Play
marketplaces.</div>

and weight initializations perform in predicting design memorability and likability. We propose and provide estimation methods based on training DCNNs to extract and evaluate two independent constructs for designs: perceptual distinctiveness ("perceptual fluency" metrics) and ambiguity in meaning ("conceptual fluency" metrics) of each logo. 
			We provide evidences of causal inference that both constructs significantly affect memory for a logo design, consistent with cognitive elaboration theory. 
			The effect on liking, however, is interactive, consistent with processing fluency (e.g., Lee and Labroo (2004), Landwehr et al. (2011).

	<button class="collapsible"> Abstract: </button> 
	<div class="content">To what extent would the sommelier profession, or wine stewardess, be displaced by machine learning algorithms? There are at least three essential skills that make a sommelier: wine theory, blind tasting, and beverage service, as exemplified in the rigorous certification processes of certified sommeliers and above (advanced and master) with the most authoritative body in the industry, the Court of Master Sommelier (hereafter CMS). 
				We propose and train corresponding machine/deep learning models that match these skills, and compare algorithmic results with real data collected from a large group of certified wine professionals. We find that our machine learning models outperform human sommeliers on most tasks --- most notably in deduction as an essential part of blind tasting, where both hierarchically supervised Latent Dirichlet Allocation outperforms sommeliers' judgment calls by over 6% in terms of F1-score; in terms of beverage service --- wine and food pairing, a modified Siamese neural networks based on BiLSTM achieves better results than sommeliers by 2%. This demonstrates, contrary to popular opinion in the industry, that the sommelier profession is at least to some extent automatable, barring economic (Kleinberg et al., 2017) and psychological (Dietvorst, 2015) complications.

		Why do people watch movies, attend sports events, read news or novels? What are the underlying drivers of their experienced 
		utility while consuming such experiential goods? Using social media sentiments as proxies for audience experience, we explore how
belief dynamics manifest in the form of suspense, surprise, prior expectations, and peak-end effects, drawing on theories in behavioral economics 
		and media psychology. While there has been extensive prior work looking into the predictive power of consumer 
		sentiment, its antecedents and drivers in the setting of experiential goods have rarely been studied. 
		We combine sentiment analysis with time series analysis (functional linear models and vector autoregressive models) 
		and provide an integrated framework for experienced utility estimation. We uncover evidences of greater effects of 
		experienced surprise than suspense at the ending, moderated by prior expectations in the setting of sporting events.</div>

	<button class="collapsible"> Abstract: </button>
	<div class="content">As  the  streaming  music  industry  gains  momentum,  music  play-listing  has  become  the  new battle field  for  major  streaming  service  providers.  We  study  the  role  of  play-lists  in  shaping  consumer  music  listening  behavior  by  asking  two  questions:  (1)  given  a  music  play-list (a  sequence  of  tracks),  
		how  should  we  specify  and  estimate  a  utility  function  of  for  an  in-dividual  consumer?  
		(2)  how  does  a  consumer  create  her  own  music  play-lists  given  whatshe  has  listened  to  in  the  past?  
		We  propose  a  two-stage  sequence  model  based  on  Long Short-Term  Memory  recurrent  neural  networks  combined  
		with  explicit  and  implicit  preferences  for  individual  tracks  from  a  hazard  and  a  discrete  choice  model.  
		In  the  first  stage, consumers  encode  tracks  they  have  listened  to  into  their  memory,  represented  as  sequence 
		embeddings  augmented  by  revealed  preferences;  in  the  second  stage,  they  create  their  ownpersonal  play-lists  
		based  on  retrieved  memory  encoded  in  the  first  stage.  We  model  and visualize  consumers'  music  memory  
		formation  and  retrieval  processes  of  consumers  using  a dataset  of  consumer  music  streaming  and  play-listing  
		behavior.  We  find  great  consumer  heterogeneity  and  uncover  three  patterns  in  play-listing  behaviors  ---
