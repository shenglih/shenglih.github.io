		<li> Abstract: This paper develops new measures of suspense and surprise in multiple distinct contexts and document robust heterogenous effects of how experienced surprise drives consumer experience and market outcomes. We motivate our analysis using Ely, Frankel and Kamenicas (2015) model of demand for non-instrumental information goods, which prescribes how suspense and surprise (and possibly other aspects of belief dynamics) shape the experienced utility function of consumers. To test the idea of the model, we develop analogous yet distinct measures of (1) functional, (2) textual, and (3) visual in corresponding contexts: (1) NFL viewership, (2) movie consumption, and (3) logo designs. We find that experienced surprise (1) Granger causes more audience response and more positive sentiments towards NFL games, (2) leads to higher evaluation of movies, and (3) correlates with greater memorability of logos, whereas suspense appears to be less effective.</li>

	Detecting Concealed Information in Text and Speech. 2019. In proceedings of <a href="http://www.acl2019.org/EN/index.xhtml"> Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL)</a>. <a href="/research/1440_Paper.pdf">[pdf]</a>
	<button class="collapsible"> Abstract: </button>
	<div class="content"> Motivated by infamous cheating scandals in various industries and political events, we address the problem of detecting concealed information in technical settings. In this work, we explore acoustic-prosodic and linguistic indicators of information concealment by collecting a unique corpus of professionals practicing for oral exams while concealing information. We reveal subtle signs of concealed information in speech and text, compare, and contrast them with those in deception detection literature, thus uncovering the link between concealing information and deception. We then present a series of experiments that automatically detect concealed information from text and speech. We compare the use of acoustic-prosodic, linguistic, and individual feature sets, using different machine learn- ing models. Finally, we present a multi-task learning framework with acoustic, linguistic, and individual features, that outperforms hu- man performance by over 15%.</div>

	<div class="content"> Mobile apps are one of the building blocks of the mobile digital economy. A
differentiating feature of mobile apps to traditional enterprise software is online
reviews, which are available on app marketplaces and represent a valuable source
of consumer feedback on the app. We create a supervised topic modeling approach
for app developers to use mobile reviews as useful sources of quality and customer
feedback, thereby complementing traditional software testing. The approach is
based on a constrained matrix factorization that leverages the relationship between
term frequency and a given response variable in addition to co-occurrences between
terms to recover topics that are both predictive of consumer sentiment and useful
for understanding the underlying textual themes. The factorization can provide
guidance on a single app’s performance as well as systematically compare different
apps over time for benchmarking of features and consumer sentiment. We apply
our approach using a dataset of over 81,000 mobile reviews over several years for
two of the most reviewed online travel agent apps from the iOS and Google Play
marketplaces.</div>

	<button class="collapsible"> Abstract: </button> 
	<div class="content">We create a dataset of 543,758 logo designs spanning 39 industrial categories and 216 countries. We experiment and compare how different deep convolutional neural network (hereafter, DCNN) architectures, pretraining protocols, 
and weight initializations perform in predicting design memorability and likability. We propose and provide estimation methods based on training DCNNs to extract and evaluate two independent constructs for designs: perceptual distinctiveness ("perceptual fluency" metrics) and ambiguity in meaning ("conceptual fluency" metrics) of each logo. 
			We provide evidences of causal inference that both constructs significantly affect memory for a logo design, consistent with cognitive elaboration theory. 
			The effect on liking, however, is interactive, consistent with processing fluency (e.g., Lee and Labroo (2004), Landwehr et al. (2011).

	<button class="collapsible"> Abstract: </button> 
	<div class="content">To what extent would the sommelier profession, or wine stewardess, be displaced by machine learning algorithms? There are at least three essential skills that make a sommelier: wine theory, blind tasting, and beverage service, as exemplified in the rigorous certification processes of certified sommeliers and above (advanced and master) with the most authoritative body in the industry, the Court of Master Sommelier (hereafter CMS). 
				We propose and train corresponding machine/deep learning models that match these skills, and compare algorithmic results with real data collected from a large group of certified wine professionals. We find that our machine learning models outperform human sommeliers on most tasks --- most notably in deduction as an essential part of blind tasting, where both hierarchically supervised Latent Dirichlet Allocation outperforms sommeliers' judgment calls by over 6% in terms of F1-score; in terms of beverage service --- wine and food pairing, a modified Siamese neural networks based on BiLSTM achieves better results than sommeliers by 2%. This demonstrates, contrary to popular opinion in the industry, that the sommelier profession is at least to some extent automatable, barring economic (Kleinberg et al., 2017) and psychological (Dietvorst, 2015) complications.

	Playlist Curation and the Consumption of Music
	<!--Data: Last.fm, MusicBrain, BillBoard Charts, Lyrics -->
	<button class="collapsible"> Abstract: </button>
	<div class="content">As  the  streaming  music  industry  gains  momentum,  music  play-listing  has  become  the  new battle field  for  major  streaming  service  providers.  We  study  the  role  of  play-lists  in  shaping  consumer  music  listening  behavior  by  asking  two  questions:  (1)  given  a  music  play-list (a  sequence  of  tracks),  
		how  should  we  specify  and  estimate  a  utility  function  of  for  an  in-dividual  consumer?  
		(2)  how  does  a  consumer  create  her  own  music  play-lists  given  whatshe  has  listened  to  in  the  past?  
		We  propose  a  two-stage  sequence  model  based  on  Long Short-Term  Memory  recurrent  neural  networks  combined  
		with  explicit  and  implicit  preferences  for  individual  tracks  from  a  hazard  and  a  discrete  choice  model.  
		In  the  first  stage, consumers  encode  tracks  they  have  listened  to  into  their  memory,  represented  as  sequence 
		embeddings  augmented  by  revealed  preferences;  in  the  second  stage,  they  create  their  ownpersonal  play-lists  
		based  on  retrieved  memory  encoded  in  the  first  stage.  We  model  and visualize  consumers'  music  memory  
		formation  and  retrieval  processes  of  consumers  using  a dataset  of  consumer  music  streaming  and  play-listing  
		behavior.  We  find  great  consumer  heterogeneity  and  uncover  three  patterns  in  play-listing  behaviors  ---  
		(1)”narrow  bracketing”;(2) ”bunching”;  (3) ”Peter Pan”,  given  revealed  preferences  for  individual  tracks.</div>
